# spaceros_gz_demos

This is a ROS 2 package demonstrating how to use Gazebo Harmonic for robotic simulations in the Space ROS environment. This package is meant to serve as a baseline for how to create Gazebo worlds, set them up with the appropriate plugins for sending controls and receiving data, and bridge these topics to ROS. The simulated worlds include a submersible robot on Enceladus, the Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter on Mars, a space capsule docking to the ISS, and two rovers on the Moon.

## Docker setup

One time setup: If you don't have Docker, install it with `sudo apt install docker.io`. You will have to add yourself to the Docker user group with `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`, then run `newgrp docker` to avoid permission errors with Docker daemon. You will also to run `xhost +local:docker` on your first time to allow Docker to connect to gui-based application such as Gazebo and RViz. You will need to log out and log back in for these changes to take effect on your system.

1. Navigate to the `docker` directory

2. Build the Docker image locally with

    ```./docker_build.sh```

3. Start the Docker container with

    ```./docker_start.sh```

4. Once you have a running container, to get another shell, run 

    ```./docker_shell.sh```

## Running code in the Docker container
1. Once you are in the Docker container, run `colcon build` (you should be in the `~/spaceros/ws` directory)

2. Run `source install/setup.bash`

3. Start one of the demos with `ros2 launch spaceros_gz_demos moon.launch.xml`, `mars.launch.xml`, or `enceladus.launch.xml`

## Moon
Launch the moon demo with the following command:

```ros2 launch spaceros_gz_demos moon.launch.xml```

This world contains an X1 rover holding a truss that can be detached, an X2 rover, and a solar panel with one controllable joint on a lunar environment.
Images, camera info, laser scans, point clouds, and odometry topics are provided for each robot.
Additionally, each rover can be commanded as a differential drive system via a commanded base twist.
This world uses the Selenographic Coordinate System (SCS).

## Mars
Launch the mars demo with the following command:

```ros2 launch spaceros_gz_demos moon.launch.xml```

This world contains models of the Perserverance rover and the Ingenuity helicopter on a Martian surface.
The Ingenuity helicopter contains a rechargable battery that simulates it charging from its solar panel.
Ingenuity can be commanded to fly.
Perserverance can be commanded as a differential drive system, and its arm joints can also be commanded to move.
Odometry topics are also published for both robots.
Perseverance and Ingenuity models are meant to be as close to their real-life counterparts as possible.
